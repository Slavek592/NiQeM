# NiQeM

Welcome to the NiQeM, Nikiforov's Quest Machine!

## Explanation

This work, NiQeM, is based on the NiLeM project.
The main difference lies in the second word of the name.
NiLeM is made for learning, NiQeM is made to create quests.
It creates a simple computer game from a few lines of code.

## How to use?

To do something, You need to download the project.
You can make any changes, but do not need to do so.
After that, You need to create an archive 
of the "NiQeM-result" folder with the name "Template.zip".
At this moment You can run the NiQeSh program (run NiQeSh.sh using console)
and give it some niqesh scripts to make levels of the quest.
An example can be found in the NiqeshScripts directory.
How to write a new niqesh script? Reed the manual.
